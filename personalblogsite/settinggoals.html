          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Goal#1: Spend three pomodoros on setting up personal blog/project website</li>
              <li>Assess progress after each pomodoros </li>
            </ul>

              <li>Spend 15 minutes reorganizing personal task board</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Goal#3: Spend three pomodoros writing Learn to Learn blog posts(2) and setting goals blog post (1)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Goal#4: Connect recently purchased domain name to deployed firebase project (currently hosting personal precourse site)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Were the goals met?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Goal 1: Spent six pomodoros on personal site. Did not take breaks to assess progress after each one.</li>
          <li>Goal 2: Yes. Trello board reorganized.</li>
          <li>Goal 3: No. Put off and worked on personal blog site instead.</li>
          <li>Goal 4: Attempted, but unsuccessful setup.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What went well?</h4>
        <p>I maintained focus on my personal site, and made considerable progress.</p>
        <h4>What didn't go well?</h4>
        <p>I did not get to writing Learn to Learn blog posts, which are a big priority right now. Frustrated by DNS Error connecting custom domain name.</p>
        <h4>What to change?</h4>
        <p>Need to stick to goal plan, and do most pressing things first. Most pressing thing at the moment is to get remaining soft skill drills finished.</p>

            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Were the goals met?</h4>
        <p>All goals met today (currently finishing writing reflection portion of goals).</p>
        <h4>What went well?</h4>
        <p>Setting pomodoros worked well. Using Trello to record goals and track progress.Took a googd lunch break. Good to step away for a little bit and come back to task. Created checklists for myself and checked off as task were completed, also recorded
          what was accomplished in timeframe. What didn't go well? Could do better job of building reflection/progress measurement into each pomodoro (maybe extend pomodoro a couple of minutes?).</p>
        <h4>What will you do differently tomorrow?</h4>
        <p>Will try longer pomodoro session, when 5 minute warning comes on, reflect assess progress, then take short break, instead of cruising straight into another timed session.</p>

        <h4>Were the goals met?</h4>
        <p>Some goals were met. Worked on setting goals. Worked on semantic html drill. Read up and practiced css excersise. Watched Layout/CSS video.
          <h4>What went well?</h4>
          <p> The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.' Setting the stage, was able to stay focused on tasks through mid afternoon. Recorded things I did, that were not on my list originally, but were
            necessary for completing goals. I downloaed and setup OBS for recording actions (needed to submit with drills). Also spent time watching HTML/CSS layout breakout video in order to learn more about setting up my personal site (and website drills).</p>
          <h4>What didn't go well?</h4>
          <p> Tried to work for too long at a time, did not do a good job of setting timer for set time periods. By 3:30pm burnt out mentally. What will you do differently tomorrow? Write more specific goals. Set pomodoro timer, and take more frequent breaks
            (work for 25-40 minutes instead of 1:30)</p>
