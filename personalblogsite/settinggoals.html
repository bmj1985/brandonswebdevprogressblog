        <ul>
          <li>Goal#1: Spend three pomodoros on setting up personal blog/project website. a. Assess progress after each pomodoros Were the goals met? Spent six pomodoros on personal site. Did not take breaks to assess progress after each one.</li>
          <li>Goal#2: Trello Organization a. Spend 15 minutes reorganizing personal task board Were the goals met? Yes. Trello board reorganized.</li>
          <li>Goal#3: Spend three pomodoros writing Learn to Learn blog posts(2) and setting goals blog post (1) Were the goals met? No. Put off and worked on personal blog site instead.</li>
          <li>Goal#4: Connect recently purchased domain name to deployed firebase project (currently hosting personal precourse site) Were the goals met? Attempted, but unsuccessful setup.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What went well? Maintained focus on personal site, made considerable progress.</p>
        <p>What didn't go well? Did not get to writing Learn to Learn blog posts, which are a big priority right now. Frustrated by DNS Error connecting custom domain name.</p>
        <p>What to change? Stick to goal plan, and do most pressing things first. Most pressing thing at the moment is to get remaining soft skill drills finished.</p>

        <p>GOALS -Work on Learn ot Learn drills - write 2-5 goals for the day -reflect on progress at end of day - Spend 60 minutes on semantic html excercise - change markup on practice file -spend 60 minutes on personal website -flesh out content - add
          semantic html - edit css -Start meetup drill -read through -set goals Were the goals met? Yes or no. Some goals were met. Worked on setting goals. Worked on semantic html drill. Read up and practiced css excersise. Watched Layout/CSS video.
          What went well? The student describes at least 2 successful actions and describes why these actions were a 'win.' Setting the stage, was able to stay focused on tasks through mid afternoon. Recorded things I did, that were not on my list originally,
          but were necessary for completing goals. I downloaed and setup OBS for recording actions (needed to submit with drills). Also spent time watching HTML/CSS layout breakout video in order to learn more about setting up my personal site (and website
          drills). What didn't go well? The student describes at least 1 action that was not a success and describes why the goal wasn't met. Tried to work for too long at a time, did not do a good job of setting timer for set time periods. By 3:30pm
          burnt out mentally. What will you do differently tomorrow? Write more specific goals. Set pomodoro timer, and take more frequent breaks (work for 25-40 minutes instead of 1:30)</p>
