        <h4>Learning objectives</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A. Practice basic html/css layout</li>
          <li>B. Gain more experience and comfort with Javascript</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
        <p>I set the stage as usual by clearing browser windows and starting with a blank browser window, iTerm window, and started pomodoro timer.
          <p>
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>Setting the stage worked well. It really helps to start with fresh windows. My tendency is to have lots of unnecessary windows open that clutter the screenspace. Starting with fresh windows reminds me to close unnecessary windows as the day
              progresses as well. Setting pomodoro timers is also hugely helpful, and I really notice a change in the quality of my productivity if I forget. Fun to go back to HTML/CSS after a couple of days away from it. It's good to revisit and cement
              skills. I found that I have a pretty good handle on flexbox, but would like to implement CSS Grid in the future. I would also like to look at and try to implement SASS down the road. I went to a Javascript breakout this afternoon and learned
              a little bit about map, and native array functions. Very much looking forward to getting into these next set of drills over the next few days. My least favourite part of the day, was going back and trying to finish these blog posts, but
              if feels good to finally get them done.</p>

        <h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
        <p>Started off the day by cycling in for the first time. Cleared open windows started fresh. Turned off notifications.
          <p>
            <h4>What I'm Learning</h4>
            <p>I started to look at some Javascript basics. Trying to watch some of the breakout videos and read over some fundamentals - arrays, variables, functions, loops, conditionals, types, expressions vs statements, and objects. Really just trying
              to wrap my head around things. Started using freeCodeCamp to go through some basic Javascript. freeCodeCamp is pretty awesome because it links with GitHub and makes commits each time your progress to a new freeCodeCamp drill.</p>
            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>I was incredibly energized and felt really mentally sharp this morning. Morning was very productive. Four Pomodoros went by very quickly. Excersising before work really helped to set the stage mentally, however I failed to bring enough food
              and by 2pm I crashed pretty hard. As usual, closing all windows and starting fresh for the day worked well. I have been able to stay incredibly focused through tasks at hand in this program so far (provided I am on campus).</p>
            <p>One thing I learned that really helped, was when solving Javascript problems, first put in what you need to create, then put in what your desired outcome is, then fill in the logic in the middle to get there. If you don't put in what you're
              trying to get out in the end, things can get really confusing, and it is hard to know what to do next.</p>

      <div class="blogtext">
        <p>Today I spent some time working on a framework/layout for a blog landing page. The goal was to build the landing page layout using html and CSS. I got to play with CSS and practice semantic html. I am starting to get a little better at CSS, working
          more quickly than I have in the past (making fewer mistakes, and getting things to look like I want in fewer tries). I set the stage by opening new browser windows and disabling notification. I spent five 30 minute pomodoro sessions working
          with the html and CSS to create the blog landing page. Something that I really started playing with this morning was root em for font size and viewport units (viewheight/viewwidth) for sizing elements on the page. I had previously mostly used
          pixels to size html. Using rem and vh/vw with flex properties made things go faster, and was really straight forward (and easy to adjust). Looking forward to continue to play with CSS to build more complex websites. (A note about setting the
          stage video: slowly getting better at using keyboard shortcuts rather than the mouse, but still using the mouse until I catch myself and switch.)</p>
