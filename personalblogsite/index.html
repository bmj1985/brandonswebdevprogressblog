        <div class="blogpost"><h4>Setting the Stage<h4>
          <p>Started off the day by cycling in for the first time. Cleared open windows started fresh.  Turned off notifications.
            <h4>What I'm Learning</h4>
        <p>I started to look at some Javascript basics. Trying to watch some of the breakout videos and read over some fundamentals - arrays, variables, functions, loops, conditionals, types, expressions vs statements, and objects. Really just trying to
          wrap my head around things. Started using freeCodeCamp to go through some basic Javascript. freeCodeCamp is pretty awesome because it links with GitHub and makes commits each time your progress to a new freeCodeCamp drill.</p>
        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>I was incredibly energized and felt really mentally sharp this morning. Morning was very productive. Four Pomodoros went by very quickly. Excersising before work really helped to set the stage mentally, however I failed to bring enough food and
          by 2pm I crashed pretty hard. As usual, closing all windows and starting fresh for the day worked well. I have been able to stay incredibly focused through tasks at hand in this program so far (provided I am on campus).</p></div>

        <div class="blogpost"><p>Goal#1: Spend three pomodoros on setting up personal blog/project website. a. Assess progress after each pomodoros Were the goals met? Spent six pomodoros on personal site. Did not take breaks to assess progress after each one. Goal#2: Trello Organization  a. Spend 15 minutes reorganizing personal task board Were the goals met? Yes. Trello board reorganized. Goal#3: Spend three pomodoros writing Learn to Learn blog posts(2) and setting goals blog post (1) Were the goals met? No. Put off and worked on personal blog site instead. Goal#4: Connect recently purchased domain name to deployed firebase project (currently hosting personal precourse site) Were the goals met? Attempted, but unsuccessful setup. What went well? Maintained focus on personal site, made considerable progress. What didn't go well? Did not get to writing Learn to Learn blog posts, which are a big priority right now. Frustrated by DNS Error connecting custom domain name. What to change? Stick to goal plan, and do most pressing things first. Most pressing thing at the moment is to get remaining soft skill drills finished.

          <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
          <h3>Colorado Open Source Operating System User Group: Android - You already have linux on your phone</h3>
          <h4>People I Met</h4>
          <p>Vincent Buscarello Backend development at UCROO Gave me a brief overview/conceptual introduction to docker</p>
          <p>Pete Silva Web Dev Instructor Galvanize Boulder</p>
          <h4>What I Learned</h4>
          <p>I learned that Android is a distro of Linux (basically Android is built on a kernal of Linux?). I'm sure I don't fully understand this, but it was cool to get introduced to it. Termux is an Android command line app that mimics Linux.</p>
          <p>I learned a little bit about(basically introduced to vocab or concepts): Kotlin busybox/toybox tombstone logcat heard a little bit about sockets.</p>
          <p>This was definitely the densest (and perhaps most interesting meetup I've been to yet). Once I got over the stereotypical CS personalities (think Milton from Office Space but really really smart), it was a really fascinating meetup, where I was constantly bombarded with new vocabulary and concepts. I just tried to follow along as best I could. I did try and brew install Android SKD components for fun (unsuccessfully, got through installing Java, but could not get android-sdk to install).</p>
          <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
          <p>Questions: What is Kotlin? How is it used? What is the integration with Javascript? This looks interesting and new. I have for the last ten years or so been a mac/iphone person, so it was cool/interesting to see a bunch of developers nerd out
            over Android backend.</p>
