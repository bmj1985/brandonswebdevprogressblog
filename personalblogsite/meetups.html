        <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
        <h3>Colorado Open Source Operating System User Group: Android - You already have linux on your phone</h3>
        <h4>People I Met</h4>
        <p>Vincent Buscarello Backend development at UCROO Gave me a brief overview/conceptual introduction to docker</p>
        <p>Pete Silva Web Dev Instructor Galvanize Boulder</p>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>I learned that Android is a distro of Linux (basically Android is built on a kernal of Linux?). I'm sure I don't fully understand this, but it was cool to get introduced to it. Termux is an Android command line app that mimics Linux.</p>
        <p>I learned a little bit about(basically introduced to vocab or concepts): Kotlin busybox/toybox tombstone logcat heard a little bit about sockets.</p>
        <p>This was definitely the densest (and perhaps most interesting meetup I've been to yet). Once I got over the stereotypical CS personalities (think Milton from Office Space but really really smart), it was a really fascinating meetup, where I was constantly bombarded with new vocabulary and concepts. I just tried to follow along as best I could. I did try and brew install Android SKD components for fun (unsuccessfully, got through installing Java, but could not get android-sdk to install).</p>
        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <p>Questions: What is Kotlin? How is it used? What is the integration with Javascript? This looks interesting and new. I have for the last ten years or so been a mac/iphone person, so it was cool/interesting to see a bunch of developers nerd out
          over Android backend.</p>

        <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
        <h3>Code For Denver: Project Night</h3>
        <h4>People I Met</h4>
        <p>Tommasina Miller, Rails developer at Granicus</p>
        <p>Fred Lintz, web development student in third quarter of 6 month program at University of Denver.</p>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>Code for Denver is a really awesome organization where volunteer come
        to work on projects for three hours every Monday night. It is a brigate of Code for America and the focus is on civically minded open source projects. It was cool to both learn about the organization, meet some people, and to see a little of their
        workflow - both development workflow and general organizational workflow. They take volunteers each week to handle next weeks tasks as far as meetups go. Each week new members are onboarded. As far as project organization they use Flowdock and
        Waffle.io. I got to see a little of re:Imagine Denver's project and folks working on it. This was a particularly interesting first meetup to go to, as developers were actively working on projects they were invested in, and all are encouraged to
        participate, as opposed to a talk or more of a social/networking meetup.</p>
        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <p>Wow! There is so much I don't know. Looking forward to learning more and being able to contribute to this group or other groups like it. I would like to spend
        some time learning a little about ruby/ruby on rails, as I don't even know the basics.</p>
