        <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
        <h3>Colorado Open Source Operating System User Group: Android - You already have linux on your phone</h3>
        <h4>People I Met</h4>
        <p>Vincent Buscarello Backend development at UCROO Gave me a brief overview/conceptual introduction to docker</p>
        <p>Pete Silva Web Dev Instructor Galvanize Boulder</p>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>I learned that Android is a distro of Linux (basically Android is built on a kernal of Linux?). I'm sure I don't fully understand this, but it was cool to get introduced to it. Termux is an Android command line app that mimics Linux.</p>
        <p>I learned a little bit about(basically introduced to vocab or concepts): Kotlin busybox/toybox tombstone logcat heard a little bit about sockets.</p>
        <p>This was definitely the densest (and perhaps most interesting meetup I've been to yet). Once I got over the stereotypical CS personalities (think Milton from Office Space but really really smart), it was a really fascinating meetup, where I was
          constantly bombarded with new vocabulary and concepts. I just tried to follow along as best I could. I did try and brew install Android SKD components for fun (unsuccessfully, got through installing Java, but could not get android-sdk to install).</p>
        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <p>Questions: What is Kotlin? How is it used? What is the integration with Javascript? This looks interesting and new. I have for the last ten years or so been a mac/iphone person, so it was cool/interesting to see a bunch of developers nerd out
          over Android backend.</p>

        <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
        <h3>Denver Tech & Design Community: Product Design in the Outdoor Industry</h3>
        <h4>People I Met</h4>
        <p>Elizabeth Sasseman, Graphic and UX Design The Rolland Group Boulder</p>
        <p>Laxman Gani , User/Customer Experience (UX/CX) & Product Management Expert at Builder Homesite</p>
        <p>Paige Jensen, formerly of La Sportiva North America</p>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>The meetup was a panel discussion about the intersection of physical product design in the outdoor industry and digital product design. Panel members were:</p>
        <ul class="bloglist">
          <li>Adam Hevenor, Product Manager at Pivotal, Inc.</li>
          <li>Matt Maczuzak, co-founder and Managing Partner, Alchemy Bicycle Co.</li>
          <li>Jedd Rose, Founder and President, Topo Designs</li>
          <li>Eric Whewell, Senior Designer at Boa Technology</li>
          <li>Moderated/facilitated by: Chuck Sullivan, Something Independent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As someone who has worked on the retail side of the outdoor industry for the last three years, and am now becoming a web developer this was an interesting panel discussion to listen to. I was particularly interested to hear what Adam Hevenor at
          Pivotal had to say, as it relates most to what I am doing right now, and also is the thing I'm least familiar with. One of the questions posed to all panelists was, "What would you like to be remembered for?." In response to this, Adam talked
          about open source projects being the one thing he does that has a chance at lasting ten to fifteeen years (an eternity in the tech world). He mentioned Linux as an open source project that has lasted forty years, and while he didn't think anything
          he worked on would last that long, it's a testament to the value and lasting impact of open source. He also talked about Pivotal being a very metrics driven place. It was cool to have some idea of what he meant when he talked about test driven
          development too. I was reminded that generally speaking there is not a ton of money in the outdoor industry, for most people in the industry they are there because they love it and they can make a living (but not a killing). It did feel super
          comfortable and familiar - maybe I'll end up back in the outdoor industry yet, who knows.</p>
        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <p>What are some open source projects I would be interested in contributing to? Curious to explore this more. Am I interested in working as a developer back in the outdoor industry? Time will tell here, and I'll continue to investigate.</p>

        <h2>Meetup Information</h2>
        <h3>Code For Denver: Project Night</h3>
        <h4>People I Met</h4>
        <p>Tommasina Miller, Rails developer at Granicus</p>
        <p>Fred Lintz, web development student in third quarter of 6 month program at University of Denver.</p>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>Code for Denver is a really awesome organization where volunteer come to work on projects for three hours every Monday night. It is a brigate of Code for America and the focus is on civically minded open source projects. It was cool to both learn
          about the organization, meet some people, and to see a little of their workflow - both development workflow and general organizational workflow. They take volunteers each week to handle next weeks tasks as far as meetups go. Each week new members
          are onboarded. As far as project organization they use Flowdock and Waffle.io. I got to see a little of re:Imagine Denver's project and folks working on it. This was a particularly interesting first meetup to go to, as developers were actively
          working on projects they were invested in, and all are encouraged to participate, as opposed to a talk or more of a social/networking meetup.</p>
        <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
        <p>Wow! There is so much I don't know. Looking forward to learning more and being able to contribute to this group or other groups like it. I would like to spend some time learning a little about ruby/ruby on rails, as I don't even know the basics.</p>
